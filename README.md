# About

It is a project for the freeCodeCamp Data Visualization certification - [Data Visualization](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/).

This project requires us to create a treemap diagram by using the dataset of movies provided by freeCodeCamp with D3 which is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/EZKqza)
